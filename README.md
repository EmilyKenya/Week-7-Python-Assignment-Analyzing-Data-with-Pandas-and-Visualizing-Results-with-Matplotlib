**Sales Data Analysis with Pandas & Matplotlib**
**Overview**

This project demonstrates how to analyze and visualize data using the Pandas and Matplotlib libraries in Python.
The dataset used is a sample sales dataset containing daily sales of products (Phones, Laptops, Tablets) across different regions.

**Objectives**

Load and explore a dataset using Pandas.

Perform basic statistical analysis (mean, totals, descriptive statistics).

Create visualizations with Matplotlib and Seaborn:

Line chart (Revenue trend over time)

Bar chart (Average revenue per region)

Histogram (Units sold distribution)

Scatter plot (Units sold vs. Revenue)

**Files**
sales_data.csv → Sample sales dataset.

sales_analysis.ipynb → Jupyter Notebook with full analysis and visualizations.

**How to Run**

Install dependencies:

pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn jupyter


Open the notebook:

jupyter notebook sales_analysis.ipynb


Run each cell to explore the dataset and generate charts.

**Findings**

Phones sell the most units across regions.

Laptops generate high revenue despite fewer units sold (higher unit price).

Sales performance varies by region, with North & East showing strong performance.

Clear trends can be seen when visualizing data with charts.
